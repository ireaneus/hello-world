# hello-world
My first repository

# This is my first edit of my hello-world project
I enjoy Golfing, white-water rafting, and Open Source computing.  I am a christian, but I don't think it is a good idea to mix my professional business dealings and my religion.

I provide the best possible service as an IT professional and am passionate about the Open Source environment.

'nuff said.
